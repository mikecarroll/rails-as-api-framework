# Rails as an API Framework

This is a guest lecture I gave to Deborah Estrin's CS5454 ("Mobile and Ubiquitous Computing") course at Cornell Tech on December 10, 2014.

The requested topic (from students) was "Comparing Mobile API Frameworks", but I made a few modifications to the focus to be more on how I build APIs using Rails (and why I think Rails is an ideal starting framework for first-time API creators).

If anybody would like me to update this presentation and give it as a talk at a meetup or other event, reach out to me on Twitter: [@_mcarroll_](https://twitter.com/_mcarroll_) Would be happy to flesh this out to go deeper into using Rails for APIs, like ActionController::Metal, OAuth, and optimizing configuration on the Rack level.

> P.S. -- This presentation is built with [bespoke.js](http://markdalgleish.com/projects/bespoke.js)!
